## WebSockets, ContentEditor, FabricJS, Screen, and Major Refactor

hyperscala 0.10.0 is a major refactoring to support better and more efficient communication between client and server via
the Realtime module. Additionally, the architecture has been simplified and cleaned up to make creating web pages even
easier than before. New ContentEditor feature has been added to better support rich content editing in the browser.
Added wrapper support for FabricJS. Created new interface for dynamic multi-page representations without loading a new
page in the browser called Screen. Examples have been updated and deprecated code has been removed in this major update.
